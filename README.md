This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The project was implemented thinking of a simple catalog.
This means simple visualization of data fed from api.

There are certainly many improvements to be made:
- add unit, functional and component tests
- improve css and UI
- the filter is using a simple linear search and could be improved as the need grows
- Third party lib is used to assist in converting from Xml to json
- there is no use of redux to manage states. Only pure react.
