Tampon products listing, filtering, comparing

Hi Italo,

I hope you had a great start to the week. 

You can find the challenge below - it's important to note that this is by no means a test, we want to get a sense for how you write code and solve problems!

At Daye, we customise the types and amounts of tampons given to each customer to make sure what they are getting is right for them.

We have an API that returns a list of our packages and what’s in them. We would like you to read the api and display it in a readable way using React. In addition it would be great if you could add in some sort of filtering mechanic to the frontend based on some of the differences between the packages.

Feel free to use any packages you want to achieve this!

We have a “bug” in this api that causes some of the tampon lists to be returned as an xml string rather then JSON so make sure you bare this in mind when parsing!

The api can be found here: https://front-end-test-bvhzjr6b6a-uc.a.run.app

I have copied Sam in case you have any questions.

Looking forward,
